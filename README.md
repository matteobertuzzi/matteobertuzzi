# Hey, I am Matteo!

👋 Hey there! I'm Matteo Bertuzzi, passionate Full-Stack Web Developer and Blogger. With a lifelong love for technology and coding, I've honed my skills in both front-end and back-end development, specializing in JavaScript, React, and Python.

💻 As a developer, I thrive on turning concepts into reality, integrating front-end and back-end technologies to build user-friendly web applications. My toolkit includes JavaScript, React, Python, HTML, and CSS, among others.

📚 Continuous learning is at the core of my ethos, as I believe education and curiosity are the keys to personal and professional growth. Beyond coding, I have experience in the field of Marketing Automation, CRM systems, and WordPress, allowing me to delve into the realms of SEO, Email Marketing, and Customer Relationship Management.

🌐 Proficient in English, German, Spanish, and Italian, my multilingual background enriches my perspective in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and business.

🍳 When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new recipes, documenting my passion for healthy eating on my food blog. Away from screens and kitchen, I like traveling and exercising, pursuing my fitness goals.
