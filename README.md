### Hey, I am Matteo!

# 🚀 About Me:

Greetings! I'm Matteo Bertuzzi, a 23-year-old Marketing Automation Manager and aspiring Full-Stack Web Developer. As a student of International Marketing and Management, I bring a global perspective to my work.

## 💼 Professional Skills:

Working in the field of Marketing Automation and CRM management (Zoho CRM) and blogger, I have advanced knowledge in the realms of SEO, Social Media Marketing, Email Marketing, and Customer Relationship Management (software). My technical proficiency includes HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which is growing day-by-day during my studies as a full-stack developer. With a knack for website development and WordPress customization, I am passionate about bringing creativity to code.

## 🌐 Web Development Journey:

Currently deep-diving into full-stack web development, I'm driven by a fascination for coding and programming. More than writing lines of code, I am passionate about creating digital landscapes that perform, captivate and connect.

## 🌎 Multilingual Background:

Proficient in English, German, and Spanish, with Italian as my mother tongue, I love learning new languages, as well as connecting with other cultures. I bring my international perspective into the world of technology and business.

## 🍲 Food Blogging:

Beyond my professional experience, I am a passionate food blogger. On my self-created website, I share with the online world my passion for healthy eating. My blogging experience has allowed me to express my creativity while gaining knowledge and first-hand experience in website development, WordPress, digital marketing, SEO, and social media marketing.

## 💡 Curiosities & Hobbies:

Away from the screens, you'll find me traveling, tasting new foods, creating healthy recipes, or running. Obviously, when I am not immersed in my learnings as a full-stack website developer!
